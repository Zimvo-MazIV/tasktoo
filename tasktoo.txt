PROMPTS: 

>>1. Hello Chat I'd like for you to create an application for me that reads a file
Response: 
	Absolutely! I can help with that. To get started, I just need a few details from you:
	
	1. **What kind of file** do you want the application to read? (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, etc.)
	2. **What should the app do** with the file's contents? (e.g., display it, search it, analyze it, convert it)
	3. Do you have a **preferred programming language or framework**? (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.)
	4. Should this be a **command-line app**, a **web app**, or a **desktop GUI**?

	Once I have those details, we can start building it step by step (or I can generate the full code if youâ€™d 	prefer that).

>>2.  1. The kind of file is an xml file 2. The app should print the file contents 3. Using the Java language, this is a command-line app

>>3. Now we are going to switch things up a bit and introduce user-selected fields from the XML File.
>>4. Each record has the following fields: name, postalZip, region, country, address and list.
>>5. Now change the format of the user fields.
>>6. The format should be the JSON format.
>>7. What will occur if a user inputs the wrong field or misspells a field? can you fix this?
>>8. Is it possible to switch to a different parser?
>>9. switch to the SAX XML parser.
